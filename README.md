# Rap God - Discord Edition

[Rap God](https://github.com/jedevc/royal-hackaway-2019) was a pretty cool hackathon project, built using the Nexmo API. I thought it would be cool to implement the same thing, but inside of Discord using voice channels...

## Development

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

Requires ffmmeg installed separately for audio
